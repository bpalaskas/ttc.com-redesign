      <p>
        The Terms of Service for working with Exanor. are described hereunder.
        By agreeing to work with Exanor or utilize any Exanor services or Exanor website, the customer accepts these Terms and Conditions. This includes as attached to any agreement that refers to these terms in print or electronically, by signing.
        These Terms and Conditions regulate the service(s) provided by Exanor, as described in a service agreement and executed by Exanor and between Exanor and the Customer. As a result, all parties agree and acknowledge the following:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="terms__box">
      <h3>1. Policies</h3>
      <p>
        All services are subject to Exanor specifications and policies, which can be modified or changed at any time. Exanor reserves the right to amend or change any services to comply with these policies. All communication regarding Exanor policies and services shall be done only through the Exanor website, through applicable phone numbers listed on the website or by email to specified Exanor.com email addresses.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="terms__box">
      <h3>2. Exanor Website Content</h3>
      <p>
        All content on this website, both in its entirety as well as any individual website pages or pieces of content, is copyrighted to Exanor. Without explicit written consent and authorization by Exanor, it should never be reproduced or copied to another website.<br /><br />
        Any websites, apps, or documents that scrape content from this site through the usage of RSS feeds, bots, or manual methods will be reported to their web hosting company with a DMCA takedown notice.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="terms__box">
      <h3>3. The Campaign</h3>
      <p>
        Exanor is not responsible for the accuracy of any information that is provided by the customer. Exanor does not and cannot guarantee a particular position(s) or appearance of a customer’s website in search engine listings. Despite best efforts, Exanor does not guarantee the appearance or position of the customer’s website in search engines due to a variety of factors and aspects of search engine performance regulations, search algorithms, and service providers.<br /><br />
        Websites that are submitted to search engines, directors, or other such lists are not guaranteed to be accepted due to reasons unrelated to Exanor. that are out of the control of the Exanor company.<br /><br />
        Individual on-site services can only be performed by Exanor after the client provides access to the services contracted website. If, due to a customer’s failure to provide such access, Exanor is unable to perform services, no refund will be issued. Exanor is not responsible for any technical issues unrelated to Exanor such as server downtime and other matters.<br /><br />
        Campaign development reports and other progress reports are available upon request or if otherwise mutually agreed upon by Exanor and the client. The details regarding such reports will be explicitly stated in the agreement.<br /><br />
        Due to search engine indexing, SEO customers should expect changes in incoming traffic volume and quality after approximately 90 days (three months) from the service activation date. This timeframe can vary depending on several factors, many of which Exanor cannot control.<br /><br />
        The customer grants Exanor permission to use software programs to retrieve and analyze websites associated with the campaign and provision of service.<br /><br />
        Should a customer fail to provide payment, or promptly respond to Exanor representatives, Exanor may reject or terminate services at any time. Other reasons that prevent our team from successfully completing the outlined work will also result in termination.<br /><br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="terms__box">
      <h3>4. Cancellation</h3>
      <p>
        Within 24 hours of receipt of payment, the customer may cancel the Contract without cause by emailing payments@exanor.com or by calling 111-222-3333. Customer will be entitled to a full refund within the first 24 hours from payment. After this point, a customer may cancel the Contract but will be entitled to no refund.<br /><br />
        Should a customer wish to cancel beyond the first 24 hours, this can be done by contacting Exanor directly through official communication channels. Monthly fees for completed months will be charged, and services will be provided in full for all paid months unless otherwise requested by the customer. Incomplete months will be rounded up to the next complete month. Any deposits paid for services will not be refunded after more than 24 hours of payment.<br /><br />
        Exanor may modify services, campaigns and/or the terms of these services or campaigns at any time by giving the customer a one-week Notice of Change. If the customer chooses to continue with services after the Notice of Change is delivered, the customer is considered to have accepted the Change to the Terms.<br /><br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="terms__box">
      <h3>5. Prohibited Uses, License Grant, Representations and Warranties</h3>
      <p>
        The customer shall not advertise, authorize or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practices. The customer will not violate or encourage the violation of any laws, regulations, codes of conduct. As well as third Party rights, including, without limitation, and intellectual property rights. Violation may result in immediate termination of the agreement.<br /><br />
        The customer grants Exanor all rights including copyright, trademark, patent and such other rights for the purpose of carrying out the services listed in the agreement. Customer represents and warrants that all provided information is complete, accurate and current.<br /><br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="terms__box">
      <h3>6. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, Exanor DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NONINFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE, EXCEPT FOR INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES.

That includes any changes made by Google or other search engines to their algorithms or design which may affect website placement or positioning. That is a continuing indemnity which shall remain in full force until such time that it is terminated.<br /><br />

    <div class="terms__box">
      <h3>8. Payment</h3>
      <p>
        Customer shall be responsible for all charges as set in the contract plus applicable taxes and shall pay all costs in Canadian Dollars or equivalent to CAD with current market exchange rate unless otherwise specified. Deposits paid are non-refundable after 24 hours have passed from the payment being made. Once the customer agrees to the project quote and pays the deposit, the customer is committed to the completion of the project and any fees explained at the time of the quote was provided.<br /><br />
        All work will be temporarily suspended in cases of declined or missing payment. In these situations, the customer must provide alternative payment within 7 days of being notified of the non-payment situation. If the payment is not provided within these 7 days, the service and the account will be canceled. Exanor reserves the right to revert the customer’s website to pre-contract state and cancel or suspend all listings in situations of non-payment. Exanor reserves the right to legal action against the customer for outstanding balances. The customer is responsible for paying all taxes, government charges, and reasonable expenses and legal fees Exanor incurs if any further action is required to collect outstanding payments.<br /><br />
        If late payments, lack of response from the customer, or other issues result in a collections agency being utilized to collect outstanding payments, and the customer wishes to continue with the project, all fees associated with collections efforts will be added to the customer account and will become due immediately.<br /><br />
        Where permitted by law, customer waives claim related to charges unless claimed within 30 days from the date of the charge. Customer understands and agrees that any financial and billing information, such as credit card information and other payment information provided to Exanor, may be shared with companies who work on Exanor’s behalf. That includes payment processors and/or sales agents. This information is shared solely for the purposes of processing payment. Exanor may also provide such information to a valid legal process, or to defend against the legal action. Exanor is liable for the use of such information by these third parties.<br /><br />
